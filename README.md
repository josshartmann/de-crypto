# Coinmarketcap Spider

This is a Scrapy spider project designed to scrape data from the [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com) website. The spider extracts information about cryptocurrencies' names, symbols, and values from the top section of the website. It then iterates over all the pages to collect data from each page.
